# Chain Reaction

### The Game
The game is called Chain Reaction, where players play against each other by placing particular coloured atoms in the game grid, and the player who's atoms dominate the grid, wins.

### What are the Rules to Play this Game?
The rules of the game are simple:
* Each player can click to add their colour of atom in any of the cells of the grid.
* Each cell in the grid can hold (number of neighbouring cells)-1 number of atoms.
* After the cell in the grid reaches its limit, the atoms split and move to the neighbouring cells.
* If there is another colour atom adjacent to the cell, it gets devoured by the colour that split.
* The player without any of his atoms on the grid loses.
